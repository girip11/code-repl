# Basic Math In Javascript

## Arithmetic operators
| Operator | Purpose           |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| +        | Addition          |
| -        | Subtraction       |
| \*       | Multiplication    |
| /        | Division          |
| %        | Remainder(modulo) |
| **       | Exponent          |

Operator precedence - PEDMAS

## Increment and decrement
* `++` - pre and post increment
* `--` - pre and post decrement

## Assignment operators
| operator | purpose             |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| +=       | add and assign      |
| -=       | subtract and assign |
| *=       | multiply and assign |
| /=       | divide and assign   |
```Javascript
let num = 100;
num += 20
console.log(num);
```

## Comparison operators
| operator | purpose                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| ===      | value and type equals. Strict equality |
| !==      | value and type are not same            |
| ==       | value equality check                   |
| !=       | values inequality check                |
| <        | less than                              |
| <=       | less than or equals                    |
| >        | greater than                           |
| >=       | greater than or equals                 |

strict equality check is recommended.
