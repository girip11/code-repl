# Duck typing in Ruby

* You can always add methods on a per object basis. In Ruby, the behavior or capabilities of an object can deviate from those supplied by its class.

* Duck Typing means an object type is defined by what it can do, not by what it is.

> In Ruby, we would use `respond_to?` or might simply pass an object to a method and know that an exception will be raised if it is used inappropriately.
> If an object walks like a duck and talks like a duck, then the Ruby interpreter is happy to treat it as if it were a duck.

~~~ruby
class Duck
  def quack
    "quack"
  end
end

class Toy
  def quack
    "quack"
  end
end

class Monkey
  def scream
    "scream"
  end
end

def quack(duck)
  duck.quack
end

quack(Duck.new)
quack(Toy.new)  # still considered as duck

quack(Monkey.new) # not a duck
