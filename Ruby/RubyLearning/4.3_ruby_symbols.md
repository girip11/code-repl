# Ruby symbols

* Symbols created by prefixing name(operator, class, module, method, variable, constant, string) with `:`. Maintained in a symbol table by the ruby interpreter.

* Symbols don't have any values unlike variables.
* `Symbol.all_symbols` dumps the symbol table

> Consider the colon to mean "thing named" so :id is "the thing named id."

* Symbols - are names of methods, classes, instance variables.
* For any given name, there is only one symbol object. In that aspect, it is memory efficient to use symbols in place of strings whenever possible

> The symbol object will be unique for each different name but does not refer to a particular instance of the name, for the duration of a program's execution. Thus, if Fred is a constant in one context, a method in another, and a class in a third, the Symbol :Fred will be the same object in all three contexts.

```ruby
puts 'hello'.object_id
puts 'hello'.object_id

puts :symbol.object_id
puts :symbol.object_id

# class methods on Symbols
Symbol.public_methods(false)

# instance level methods
Symbol.instance_methods(false)

# string to symbol and vice versa
puts "hello".to_sym.class
puts :hello.to_s.class

p :hello.length
p :hello.upcase
p :hello.downcase

# same as String.succ method
# next and succ are aliases
p :hello.next
p :hello.succ

# Symbol to proc
p :hello.to_proc

# case ignore symbol name comparison
p :hello.casecmp?(:HELLO) # returns true
```
