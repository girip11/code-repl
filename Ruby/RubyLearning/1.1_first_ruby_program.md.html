# First Ruby program

* Paranthesis is optional in a method call.

* **`puts`** stands for **put string**

* In ruby, everything is an object. All Objects have **Object** as their base class and **Object** includes **kernel** module which provides methods like **puts**.

* When a ruby application starts, **main** object which is an instance of class **Object** is automatically created and hence we will be able to access methods available in the kernel module.

* Single line comments - `#`

* Multiline comments enclosed between `=begin` and `=end`.

* Ruby is case sensitive.

* Keywords are reserved words and cannot be used as identifiers.
