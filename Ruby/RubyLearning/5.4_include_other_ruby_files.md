# Including Other ruby files

* `require` and `load` methods defined in `Object`
* `load` loads and executes the ruby file everytime the method is called.
* `require` loads and executes only once

~~~ruby
# load can be helpful in rails development environment so that changes made are
# automatically loaded without having to restart the rails server
# loads and executes 2 times
load("./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main.rb")
# extension mandatory
load "./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main.rb"

# loads and executes only once and returns true first time
require "./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main.rb"

# returns false if already required
# .rb file extension can be omitted
# helps lo
require "./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main"

> Ruby tries to load the library named string, returning true if successful. If the filename does not resolve to an absolute path, it will be searched for in the directories listed in $:. If the file has the extension ".rb", it is loaded as a source file; if the extension is ".so", ".o", or ".dll", or whatever the default shared library extension is on the current platform, Ruby loads the shared library as a Ruby extension. Otherwise, Ruby tries adding ".rb", ".so", and so on to the name. The name of the loaded feature is added to the array in $:

~~~ruby
# person.rb
# frozen_string_literal: true

class Person
  attr_reader :name, :age

  def initialize(name, age)
    @name = name
    @age = age
  end

  def to_s
    "#{name}: #{age}"
  end
end

# main.rb same folder as person.rb
require_relative 'person'

p1 = Person.new("John", 25)
puts p1

## `$LOAD_PATH`

* `$LOAD_PATH` - list of paths to search for a file that is required by `require`

~~~ruby
# $LOAD_PATH and $: are global variables
# Both contain a list of folders where require method looks up
puts $LOAD_PATH
puts $LOAD_PATH.class # Array

puts $:
puts $:.class

# $LOAD_PATH loading directories
file_dir = File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__))
#  unshift inserts at the beginning of the array
$LOAD_PATH.unshift(file_dir) unless $LOAD_PATH.include?(file_dir)
~~~

* Ruby Gems are just source code heirarchies installed in a directroy that ends up in `$LOAD_PATH`

## `require`

* `require` - searches for the given file(.rb, .so, .dll) in the ruby `$LOAD_PATH`

* `require` method can accept absolute path as well as just the file name aka shortened path(no need to specify the file extension).

* With absolute path, moving a file would break the other files that require the moved file.

* File mentioned in the form of shortened path is searched in directories in `$LOAD_PATH`.

* `require_relative` - search for a given file relative to the current file's location. Used to include other files in the same directory as the file requiring it.

* `__FILE__` - stores raltive path of the current ruby source file.

* Use require_relative when the file you need to load exists somewhere relative to the file that calls for the loading. Reserve require for "external" dependencies.
