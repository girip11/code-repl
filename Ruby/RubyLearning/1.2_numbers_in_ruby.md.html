# Numbers in Ruby

* Integer literal consists of sequence of digits. Can contain underscores with in the literal to serve as the **thousands separator**.

  ~~~Ruby
  number = 1_000
  puts number
  ~~~

* Integers can either be an instance **Fixnum** or **Bignum** both of which have **Numeric** as their base class.

* Floating points integer objects are instance of **Float** class.

* Ruby does not provide **++** or **--** operators.

* In Ruby, the **%** module operator behavior differs from that of C/Java when it comes to operands negative numbers. In Ruby, **the sign of the result (for % operator) is always the same as the sign of the second operand.**
  ~~~Ruby
  puts (5 % 3)
  puts (-5 % 3)
  puts (5 % -3)
  puts (-5 % -3)
  ~~~

* In ruby we have two sets of logical operators with different precedence. 
  * `or` , `||` - Logical OR. **`||` has higher precedence than `or`**
  * `and`, `&&` - Logical AND. **`&&` has higher precedence than `and`**
  * `!` , `not` - LOGICAL Negation. **`!` has higher precedence than `not`**

!!! Note: Important
    Logical operators `or` , `and` and `not` have lower precedence than the assignment operators, while `||`, `&&` and `!` have higher precedence than the assignment operator.

* Assigning value to a variable when its not already set applying the above operator precedence.
  ~~~ruby
  # Since || has higher precedence if var is nil
  # then the expression on the LHS will return "default" and then
  # the assignment kicks in.
  var = var || 'default'

  # idiomatic shorthand for the above expression
  var ||= "default"
  ~~~

* If logical AND, OR operators need to be evaluated after assignments, use operators `and`, `or`, `not` since these operators have lower precedence than the assignment operator.

* To print and inspect a variable to console use `p <var_name>`

* Parallel assignment
  ~~~Ruby
  var1, var2, var3 = [1, true, 'Hello']
  puts var1
  puts var2
  puts var3
  ~~~
