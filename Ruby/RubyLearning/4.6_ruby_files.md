# Read and Write Files in ruby

* `ri File::open`
* if a block is passed to the `File.open`, the file is automatically closed after the execution of the block.

## Reading file

~~~ruby
# read all the lines in a file
contents = File.open('./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main.rb', 'r') { |f|  f.readlines }
puts contents

#===================================================================
# Iterating through each line of the file
file_handle = File.open('./Tryouts/HelloWorld/main.rb', 'r')

# gets reads oneline at a time. Default separator is a new line.
while (line = file_handle.gets)
  puts "Line: #{line}"
end

file_handle.close

if file_handle.closed?
  puts "File was closed"
end

#===================================================================

# reading a csv file
file_handle = File.open('./Tryouts/sample.csv')

# gets reads oneline at a time. Default separator is a new line.
while (line = file_handle.gets(","))
  puts "Line: #{line.nil? ? "": line.chomp(",")}"
end

file_handle.close

if file_handle.closed?
  puts "File was closed"
end
~~~

## Traversing directory

* `ri Find::find`

>Calls the associated block with the name of every file and directory listed as arguments, then recursively on their subdirectories, and so on. Returns an enumerator if no block is given.

~~~ruby
require "find"

Find.find("./Tryouts", "./RubyLearning") do |f|
  puts "Is #{f} a file: #{File.file?(f)}"
  puts "Is #{f} a directory: #{File.directory?(f)}"
end
~~~

## Random access in files

* `IO::SEEK_CUR` - CURRENT file pointer value + position
* `IO::SEEK_END` - EOF + position. usually given with a negative value
* `IO::SEEK_SET` - Global positioning.

~~~ruby
# seek from current position of file pointer
file_handle = File.open('./Tryouts/sample.csv')
# seek from relative position of the current file pointer position
file_handle.seek(1, IO::SEEK_CUR)
puts file_handle.readlines
file_handle.close

# Seek from end of the file
file_handle = File.open('./Tryouts/sample.csv')
# seeks from end of the file
file_handle.seek(-2, IO::SEEK_END)
puts file_handle.readlines
file_handle.close

# Seek global position
file_handle = File.open('./Tryouts/sample.csv')
# seeks always from beginning of the file
file_handle.seek(3, IO::SEEK_SET)
puts file_handle.readlines
file_handle.close

## Object serialization

Referred to as marshalling in ruby.

* `Marshal.dump` - serialize
* `Marshal.load` - deserialize
