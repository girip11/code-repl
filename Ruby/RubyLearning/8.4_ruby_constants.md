# Ruby constants

* Constants in ruby are defined with all capital letters folllowing snake case as in SNAKE_CASE. Exception is class names and module names which are also constants but with **PascalCase** naming convention.

~~~ruby
class SimpleClass
end

module SimpleModule
end

SIMPLE_CONST = "Hello"

defined?(SimpleClass)
defined?(SimpleModule)
defined?(SIMPLE_CONST)
~~~

* Constants in ruby fixes the variable assocation with the underlying object. We can still modify object's state through the constant(constant does not freeze an object).

~~~ruby
PLANETS = Array.new

# objects state can be modified
PLANETS.append("Mercury")
PLANETS.append("Venus")

# to prevent object' state from being modified freeze the object
PLANETS.freeze

puts PLANETS.frozen?

# Now adding an item to the array raises FrozenError
PLANETS.append("Earth")
~~~

* Ruby does not strictly prohibit reassignment to a constant, instead the interpreter issues a warning.

~~~ruby
CONST_VALUE = 10
puts CONST_VALUE

# warning issued but still changed
CONST_VALUE = 100
puts CONST_VALUE

defined?(CONST_VALUE)
~~~

* Constants defined outside any class or module will be part of the `main` object and can be accessed using **the scope operator with no prefix**.

* Outside the class or module, they may be accessed using the scope operator, :: prefixed by an expression that returns the appropriate class or module. Constants defined outside any class or module may be accessed as it is or by using the scope operator with no prefix.

~~~ruby
# constants inside a class or module are public by default
class SimpleClass
  SIMPLE_CONST = 10
end

puts SimpleClass.constants
puts SimpleClass::SIMPLE_CONST

# Constants may be added to existing classes and modules
# from the outside by using the class or module name
# and the scope operator before the constant name.
SimpleClass::EXTERNAL_CONST = 100
puts SimpleClass::EXTERNAL_CONST
puts SimpleClass.constants
~~~

* **Constants may not be defined in methods.**
