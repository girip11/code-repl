# Ruby inheritance

* Class can inherit from only one base class.

~~~ruby
class Polygon
  def area
  # dummy implementation
  end
end

class Rectangle < Polygon

  # override base class implementation
  def area
    # implementation
  end
end
~~~

> Some built-in classes are Array, Bignum, Class, Dir, Exception, File, Fixnum, Float, Integer, IO, Module, Numeric, Object, Range, String, Thread, Time. Some built-in modules are Comparable, Enumerable, GC, Kernel, Math.

> The BasicObject class is the parent class of all classes in Ruby. Its methods are therefore available to all objects unless explicitly overridden. When you create a class in Ruby, you extend Object unless you explicitly specify the super-class, and most programmers will never need to use or extend BasicObject.

## `super`

* Calling `super` inside an instance_method sends message to the immediate parent of the current object invoking the method of same name.

* `initialize` is an ordinary method and is inherited like any other.

~~~ruby
class Parent
  def initialize(p1, p2)
    @p1 = p1
    @p2 = p2
  end
end

class Child < Parent
  def initialize(p1, p2, p3)
    super(p1, p2)
    @p3 = p3
  end
end
~~~

## Inheritance and instance variables

> Because instance variables are not defined by a class, they are unrelated to subclassing and the inheritance mechanism. An instance variable used by a subclass cannot "shadow" an instance variable in the super-class. If a subclass uses an instance variable with the same name as a variable used by one of its ancestors, it will overwrite the value of its ancestor's variable.

~~~ruby
# Both look equivalent, but instance vari
class Person
  @name = nil

  def name
    @name
  end

  def name=(name)
    @name = name
  end
end

# instance variables declared beforehand
Person.instance_variables

# shorthand for the above implementation
class PersonNew
  attr_accessor :name, :age
end

PersonNew.instance_variables
p1 = PersonNew.new
p1.instance_variables

p1.name = "John"
# only now instance variables are created
# When PersonNew in inherited,
# none of the instance variables will be inherited
# because none of them exists at just class definition.
# Only during instantiation and call to super method to assign
# values, these instance variables come in to existance.
p1.instance_variables
~~~
