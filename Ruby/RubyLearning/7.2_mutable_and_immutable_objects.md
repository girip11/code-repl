# Mutable and Immutable Objects

* Immutable object - no state change after creation.
* Any instance can become immutable by calling `freeze` method.

## Freezing Objects

* `Object.freeze` method - makes the object a constant.
* Changing state of freezed results in **`FrozenError`**

~~~ruby
# Ruby strings are mutable by default
message = "Hello world"
puts message.frozen?

# freezes instance point to by the variable message
message.freeze
puts message.frozen?

# raises FrozenError
puts message.downcase!

# freeze freezes the instance.
# as long as any variable points to the same instance
# trying to modify the state of the underlying object results in exception being raised.
new_message = message
puts new_message.downcase!

puts new_message.frozen?

# changing variable to point to some other object
message = "Hello"
puts message.frozen?
puts message.downcase!

# chaining assignment points to same object
a = b = 'hello'
puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id

# freezes the underlying object pointed by a
puts a.freeze

puts a.frozen?
puts b.frozen?

~~~

## Usecases

> **Copy and Freeze Pattern**
>
> Ruby sometimes copies objects and freezes the copies. When you use a string as a hash key, Ruby actually copies the string, freezes the copy, and uses the copy as the hash key: that way, if the original string changes later on, the hash key isn't affected.

* Hash key strings are made a copy and the copy is frozen and used.

~~~ruby
key = "foo"
value = "bar"
hash = { key: value }

puts key.object_id
puts key.frozen?

hash_key = hash[key]
puts hash_key.object_id
puts hash_key.frozen?
~~~

* Class can be frozen to prevent future modifications.
