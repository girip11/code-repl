# Access control in ruby

In ruby, methods of instances have three levels of access control.

* **public** - instance methods are public by default. `initialize` method is always private.
* **protected** -These methods can be invoked by the objects of the defining class as well as its subclass instances.
* **private** - These methods can be called by other methods of the same instance. The receiver is always **self**.

~~~ruby
# AccessControlExample
class Parent
  def public_method
    puts "Inside public method of Parent"
    private_method
  end

  protected
    def protected_method
      puts "Inside protected method of Parent"
      private_method
    end

  private
    def private_method
      puts "Inside private method of Parent"
    end
end

class Child < Parent
  def mtd1
    puts "Inside mtd1 of Child"
    public_method
    protected_method
  end

end

p = Parent.new
p.public_method

c = Child.new
c.mtd1
~~~

Alternate syntax

~~~ruby
# AccessControlExample
class Parent
  def public_method
    puts "Inside public method of Parent"
    private_method
  end

  def protected_method
    puts "Inside protected method of Parent"
    private_method
  end

  def private_method
    puts "Inside private method of Parent"
  end

  # public, protected and private methods are provided by Kernel module
  # puts Kernel.private_methods(false).sort
  public :public_method
  protected :protected_method
  private :private_method
end
~~~

## `protected` access control

~~~ruby
class Word
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
  end

  def get_word
    # can use self.word or @word
    self.word
  end

  def equals?(another_word)
    self.word.casecmp?(another_word.get_word)
  end

  protected :get_word
end

hello = Word.new("hello")

# instances of same class can access protected methods.
hello.equals?(Word.new("HELLO"))
~~~

> In Ruby, public, private and protected apply only to methods. Instance and class variables are encapsulated and effectively private, and constants are effectively public. There is no way to make an instance variable accessible from outside a class (except by defining an accessor method). And there is no way to define a constant that is inaccessible to outside use.

## Overriding private methods

* Instance of subclasses can invoke private methods of base classes as well as override them

> Classes often use private methods as internal helper methods. They are not part of the public API of the class and are not intended to be visible. If you happen to define a method in your subclass that has the same name as a private method in the superclass, you will have inadvertently overridden the superclass's internal utility method, and this will almost certainly cause unintended behavior.

## Accessor methods

Since **instance variables are always private in ruby**, we need accessor methods to access those instance variables outside the instance.

* `attr_accessor` - defines a getter and setter
* `attr_reader` - defines only a getter
* `attr_writer` - defines only a setter

~~~ruby
class AccessorMethodsExample
  attr_accessor :var1
  attr_reader :var2
  attr_writer :var3

  def initialize(var2)
    @var2 = var2
  end
end

obj = AccessorMethodsExample.new("getter only variable")

puts obj.public_methods(false)

obj.var1 = "hello"
puts obj.var1

# cannot assign to var2 from outside as no setter is exposed.
puts obj.var2

obj.var3 = "setter defined for variable 3"
# Using a method signature
# obj.var3=("setter defined for variable 3")

puts obj.var3
~~~

> All Ruby objects have a set of instance variables. These are not defined by the object's class - they are simply created when a value is assigned to them. Because instance variables are not defined by a class, they are unrelated to subclassing and the inheritance mechanism.

## Top level methods

Methods defined outside of any class or module are added as private instance methods to the **default main object**(This **main** object is an instance of **Object** class)

~~~ruby
# open irb
puts self # main
puts self.class # Object

puts self.instance_of?(Object)

def say_hello(name)
  puts "Hello, #{name}"
end

# `say_hello` method got added to Object
puts Object.public_method_defined?(:say_hello)

puts self.public_methods(false)
puts Object.instance_methods(false)
~~~

## Methods to find owner, receiver and access control of a method

> Virtually all Ruby objects inherit from Object and have access to the methods defined in the Kernel module, so Kernelâ€™s private instance methods are accessible virtually anywhere in a Ruby program, regardless of self.

~~~ruby
# Kernel module adds public instance method `method` to eevry instance
class Word
  def initialize(word)
    @word = word
  end

  def get_word
    @word
  end

  private
    def is_word_nil?
      @word.nil?
    end
end

puts Word.private_method_defined?(:is_word_nil?)

w = Word.new("Hello")

# get a handle to the receiver. In this case the receiver will be `w`
w.method(:is_word_nil?).receiver

# Find from where the method is coming from
w.method(:get_word).owner
w.method(:public_methods).owner
