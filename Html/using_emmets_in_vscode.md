# What are emmets?
Emmet are CSS-like expressions that can be dynamically parsed, and produce output depending on what you type in the abbreviation. For instance typing `.class` generates this html `<div class="container"></div>` while typing `#header` generates `<div id="header"></div>` in the editor.

This helps improving the productivity of the developer.

VSCode has [built in support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/emmet) for emmets. Emmet cheatsheet is available [here](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)
